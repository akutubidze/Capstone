          <h4>About Georgian Traditional Folk Music</h4>
          <p class="left-align" style="text-align: justify">
            Georgian traditional music is polyphonic and typically performed in
            three voices. It is widespread across Georgia in the South Caucasus.
            While three-part singing is most common, there are also examples of
            two- and four-voice songs. Many songs are performed by large choirs,
            which usually require at least seven singers. Some choir pieces are
            antiphonal, with the ensemble divided into two groups that alternate
            parts of the song. At the same time, trios and solo pieces are also
            part of the tradition, and many songs are accompanied by
            instruments.
          </p>

          <p class="left-align" style="text-align: justify">
            In Georgian multipart singing, each vocal part has a conventional
            name that reflects its pitch range, vocal quality, and function
            within the ensemble. Singers commonly refer to these parts using
            simple ordinal numbers.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Pirveli</strong> (“first”) refers to the highest voice,
              roughly comparable to a soprano.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Meore</strong> ("second") usually falls within the alto
              range and often carries the solo line and main melody.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bani</strong> is the Georgian term for the bass voice and
              represents the lowest part, performed either by a single singer or
              by a group.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p class="left-align" style="text-align: justify">
            In addition to these, there are specialized vocal styles such as
            "<strong>Krimanchuli</strong>" (<i>krimančuli</i>) which is
            equivalent to yodeling, and "<strong>Gamkivani</strong>"
            (<i>gamk’ivani</i>) — a register between yodeling and chest voice.
          </p>

            mountains to the south. The southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus
            form the highest parts of the country, which gradually descend into
            plains toward the center before rising again into the plateaus of
            the Lesser Caucasus.
          </p>

          <p class="left-align" style="text-align: justify">
            Most importantly, Georgia is divided into <strong>Eastern</strong>
            and <strong>Western</strong> parts by the

            mountain range, which runs north to south. This range functions as a
            natural boundary — first by creating climatic differences and acting
            as a watershed between the

            basins, and second by serving as the country’s major cultural
            divide.
          </p>

          <p class="left-align" style="text-align: justify">
            Cultural elements shaped by geography include language and accent,
            traditional dress, cuisine, and other social customs. Singing and
            dancing are also part of these distinctions. Most Georgians can
            easily distinguish between westerners and easterners by their
            speech, behavior, and sometimes even appearance. Westerners are
            often described as livelier and more energetic, while easterners are
            seen as more composed and prudent.
          </p>

          <p class="left-align" style="text-align: justify">
            Besides, the country’s physical landscape, together with
            socio-political factors, shaped the early formation of political and
            administrative divisions, which laid the foundation for Georgia’s
            historical regions around the 9th century. Today, Georgia comprises
            about 20 historical regions.

            historically lived within the Georgian kingdom but whose territories
            are not administered by Georgia today. Because of long-standing

                east of the watershed. Folk music from Eastern Georgia is
                generally more drone-based, with the middle voice leading and
                featuring fluid, ornamental, and melismatic elements.

              located in the northwestern highlands, such as Svaneti, Racha, and
              Lechkhumi, which—while distinct—share similar singing practices
              and traditions, including full-voiced singing with pitch slides
              and the use of round dances.

              Likewise, <strong>Northeastern</strong> includes several diverse
              regions — Khevi, Khevsureti, Mtiuleti, Pshavi, and Tusheti — that
              also share common traits in their folk music, such as a dominance
              of two-part and drone-based singing, performed in a subtle, nasal,
              and raw manner, with a stronger emphasis on poetry and solo
              singing.

              Georgia’s complex terrain - marked by mountains, valleys, and
              limited road access - has contributed to the development of
              distinct vocal styles across its regions. In general, song tempo
              begins at a slower pace in the east and gradually becomes faster
              and more energetic toward the west.

            <p class="left-align" style="text-align: justify">
              - Eastern traditions tend to feature extended vowel sounds and
              rich melismas.<br />
              - As one moves toward central regions like Kartli and Imereti, the
              pace quickens and the singing becomes more syllabic and lively,
              resulting in the most rapid-paced songs in western areas such as
              Guria and Achara.<br />
              - In the northern highlands, the style shifts again: songs are
              typically sung with greater vocal power, using open,
              full-throated techniques that reflect the mountainous
              environment.<br />
              - Southern Georgia, by contrast, maintains vocal traits more in
              line with eastern practices.

              Abkhazia and Samachablo (South Ossetia) are shown in grey to
              reflect their current separation from Georgia. Although these
              regions have different ethnic and linguistic identities, their
              historical inclusion within Georgian statehood and their place in
              the wider Caucasus cultural landscape have contributed to

                Abkhazian songs are structurally similar to Georgian songs, as
                they also feature two- and three-voiced polyphony. However,
                differences in language and vocal style give Abkhazian folk
                music its unique character. Stylistically, it aligns more
                closely with Mingrelian choral singing, often marked by
                high-pitched shout-like or scream-like vocal elements In terms
                of sound, Abkhazian folk music stands apart. While Georgian
                singing often follows harmonic patterns based on fifths or
                seconds, Abkhazian songs may break from this structure—featuring
                wider descending intervals, such as a sixth, and occasionally
                adding a fourth voice between the top and middle, a
                configuration not found in Georgian traditions.

                Ossetian folk songs are typically arranged in two or three
                voices. The sound has its own strong character. It resembles
                the eastern Georgian tradition, especially in mountainous
                traits—such as loud, chest-driven singing, shout-like
                expression, and round-dance forms. It also shares similarities
                with North Caucasian sound traditions due to its location near
                North Ossetia on the northern side of the Greater Caucasus, a
                region with its own diverse folk music tradition.

            (Scherbaum et al., 2020), showing clear consistency. The chart
            reflects the average harmonic interval distribution observed in the
            study. Svaneti’s geographic isolation in the high Caucasus has
            helped preserve its language and singing style, which may represent
            one of the most authentic forms of Georgian vocal tradition. The
            authors emphasize that their analysis is descriptive rather than
            evaluative, aiming simply to document measurable aspects of current
            Georgian vocal practices in an unbiased way.
