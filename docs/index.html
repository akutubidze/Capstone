            Georgian traditional music is a folk singing tradition found across Georgia in the South Caucasus. It encompasses musical traditions performed in four different languages: Abkhazian, Ossetian, Mingrelian, Svan, and Georgian. The first two languages belong to the Northwest Caucasian and Indo-European language families, while the latter two are part of the Georgian (Kartvelian) family.

      <h2>What do you need to know about Georgian traditional music:</h2>

      <p class="left-align">
        Traditional Georgian songs are multivocal, typically structured in three parts. Each voice has its own name in Georgian, determined by its range and role in the song:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-1">
        <li>Pirevli (Top) – The highest-pitched voice, equivalent to a soprano</li>
        <li>Meore (Middle) – Usually in the alto range, often carrying the solo or main melody</li>
        <li>Bani (Bottom) – Functions as the bass, which can be either a steady drone or highly mobile, depending on the song's origin.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="left-align">
        Georgian traditional music varies across the country, with each region on the map having its own distinct style. The primary division is between Western and Eastern styles:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-1">
        <li>
          Western – Includes music from regions west of the Likhi mountain range, which runs north-south and divides Georgia. This style is marked by a more energetic and lively singing style, often with all three voices maintaining independent yet harmonious melodies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Eastern – Refers to music from regions east of the Likhi range. Eastern Georgian folk music tends to be more drone-based, with the middle voice leading and more fluid melodic elements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="left-align">
        Additionally, Georgian folk music varies from north to south but generally aligns with the East-West classification. However, <strong>Abkhazian, Svan, and Ossetian</strong> traditions have their own unique sounds, while the mountainous eastern regions place strong emphasis on poetic lyrics and instrumental accompaniment.

        Another important topic of interest is the authentic Georgian tuning system. The scale used in Georgian traditional music has an untempered character. While some debate still exists, recent studies on Georgian tuning models confidently suggest that it deviates significantly from the 12‑TET (twelve‑tone equal temperament) Western system and does so with internal consistency.
      </p>
      <p class="left-align">
        Using a dataset compiled from multitrack audio, video, and descriptive documentation recorded during a 2016 research expedition in Georgia, a pitch contour was generated through pitch‑tracking analysis of the audio material.
