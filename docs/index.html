        <h4>About Georgian Traditional Folk Music</h4>
        <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
          Georgian traditional music is polyphonic and typically performed in three voices. 
          It is widespread across Georgia in the South Caucasus. While three-part singing is most common, there are also examples of two- and four-voice songs. 
          Many songs are performed by large choirs, which usually require at least seven singers. 
          Some choir pieces are antiphonal, with the ensemble divided into two groups that alternate parts of the song. 
          At the same time, trios and solo pieces are also part of the tradition, and many songs are accompanied by instruments.
        </p>

        <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
          In Georgian folk music, each vocal part has its own name based on range and structural role within a song. 
          In his dissertation "Dissected Listening: A Media History of Georgian Polyphony", Brian Robert Fairley provides a clear explanation of these roles. 
        </p>

        <ul> 
          <li><strong>Pirveli</strong> (Top) refers to the highest voice, comparable to the soprano.</li> 
          <li><strong>Meore</strong> (Middle) usually falls within the alto range and often carries the solo line and main melody.</li> 
          <li><strong>Bani</strong> (Bass) corresponds to the bass, which can be either steady and sustained or highly mobile depending on the song’s origin.</li> 
        </ul>

        In addition to these, there are specialized vocal styles such as "<strong>Krimanchuli</strong>" (<i>krimančuli</i>) which is equivalent to yodeling, and "<strong>Gamkivani</strong>" (<i>gamk’ivani</i>) — a register between yodeling and chest voice.

        <br>

        <h4>Geographical Context of Georgian Folk Music</h4>
        <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
          Georgia is located in the South Caucasus and extends east to west. 
          It is situated between the Greater Caucasus to the north and the Lesser Caucasus to the south. 
          The southern slopes of the Greater Caucasus form the highest parts of the country, which gradually descend into plains toward the center before rising again into the plateaus of the Lesser Caucasus.
        </p>
        <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
          Most importantly, Georgia is divided into <strong>Eastern</strong> and <strong>Western</strong> parts by the <strong>"Likhi"</strong> mountain range, which runs north to south. 
          This range functions as a natural boundary — first by creating climatic differences and acting as a watershed between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea basins, and second by serving as the country’s major cultural divide.
        </p>
        <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
          Cultural elements shaped by geography include language and accent, traditional dress, cuisine, and other social customs. 
          Singing and dancing are also part of these distinctions. 
          Most Georgians can easily distinguish between westerners and easterners by their speech, behavior, and sometimes even appearance. 
          Westerners are often described as livelier and more energetic, while easterners are seen as more composed and prudent.
        </p>
        <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
          Besides, the country’s physical landscape, together with socio-political factors, shaped the early formation of political and administrative divisions, which laid the foundation for Georgia’s historical regions around the 9th century. Today, Georgia comprises about 20 historical regions.
        </p>

        <h4>Linguistic Context of Georgian Folk Music</h4>
        <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
          Folk songs in Georgia are performed in six different languages: <strong>Abkhazian</strong>, <strong>Ossetian</strong>, <strong>Mingrelian</strong>, <strong>Laz</strong>, <strong>Svan</strong>, and <strong>Georgian</strong>. Language plays a central role in shaping vocal style, pronunciation, and regional identity within Georgian singing traditions.
        </p>
        <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
          Two of these languages – Abkhazian and Ossetian – belong to the <strong>Northwest Caucasian</strong> and <strong>Indo-European</strong> language families. 
          The regions where they are spoken are inhabited by Abkhazians and Ossetians, non-Georgian ethnic groups who historically lived within the Georgian kingdom but whose territories are not administered by Georgia today. Because of long-standing cultural, geographical, and historical ties, their folk singing traditions are included alongside Georgian ones in this overview.
        </p>

        <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
          The remaining four – Georgian, Mingrelian, Laz, and Svan – belong to the <strong>Kartvelian</strong> (South Caucasian) language family, with Georgian serving as the dominant and most widely spoken language. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Mingrelian and Laz form the <strong>Zan</strong> subgroup.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 1.5rem;"><i>Mingrelian</i> is spoken in Samegrelo, a central-western region along the Black Sea.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 1.5rem;"><i>Laz</i>, on the other hand, is spoken in <strong>Lazistan</strong>, further southwest in the Lesser Caucasus, now within modern-day Turkey. Laz songs are not included in this project but may be added in future expansions.</li>
          <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Svan is spoken in the highland region of Svaneti, in northwestern Georgia. It is considered the most archaic Kartvelian language, preserving features that have disappeared from Georgian, Mingrelian, and Laz.</li>

          <h4>Distribution of folk music tradition</h4>
          <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
            Traditional music in Georgia varies throughout the country, with most regions having their own distinctive styles. 
            The classification of these styles is rooted in local oral traditions, and the most common division is between <strong>East</strong> and <strong>West</strong>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Western</strong> tradition — includes songs from the regions located west of the Likhi watershed ridge. 
              These songs are marked by a livelier and more dynamic tonal character, with all three voices often carrying independent melodies while remaining harmonious.</li>
            <li><strong>Eastern</strong> tradition — encompasses the regions east of the watershed.
              Folk music from Eastern Georgia is generally more drone-based, with the middle voice leading and featuring fluid, ornamental, and melismatic elements.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
            The sound also differs between the northern highlands (Greater Caucasus) and the southern plains (Lesser Caucasus).<br>
          </p>
          <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
            The map also groups regions, highlighting areas where musical traditions share similar characteristics. This grouping is entirely conceptual and is intended to emphasize stylistic similarities in folk music among regions brought together under these constructed geographical labels.<br>
          </p>
          <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
            The <strong>Northwestern</strong> grouping brings together regions located in the northwestern highlands, such as Svaneti, Racha, and Lechkhumi, 
            which—while distinct—share similar singing practices and traditions, including full-voiced singing with pitch slides and the use of round dances.
          </p>
          <p class="left-align" style="text-align:justify">
            Likewise, <strong>Northeastern</strong> includes several diverse regions — Khevi, Khevsureti, Mtiuleti, Pshavi, and Tusheti — 
            that also share common traits in their folk music, such as a dominance of two-part and drone-based singing, performed in a subtle, nasal, and raw manner, with a stronger emphasis on poetry and solo singing.

          tuning system with the measured Georgian scale, allowing you to hear the difference instantly.

              There is an ongoing debate about the existence of a distinct Georgian tuning system. <br>
              The tuning measurements in the chart below is based on nine harmonic scale degrees identified in the study “Tuning Systems of Traditional Georgian Singing Determined from a New Corpus of Field Recordings” (Universität Potsdam, International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, and the State Folk Centre of Georgia, 2022).
          The study draws on data from the Computational Analysis of Traditional Georgian Vocal Music (GVM) project, conducted in 2016 mainly in Upper Svaneti. The corpus includes recordings from Svaneti (14 choirs), Racha (2), Guria (2), and Tbilisi (1). The Svaneti tuning closely matches the one found earlier in the Erkomaishvili dataset (Scherbaum et al., 2020), showing clear consistency.
          The chart reflects the average harmonic interval distribution observed in the study. Svaneti’s geographic isolation in the high Caucasus has helped preserve its language and singing style, which may represent one of the most authentic forms of Georgian vocal tradition.
          The authors emphasize that their analysis is descriptive rather than evaluative, aiming simply to document measurable aspects of current Georgian vocal practices in an unbiased way.

              This tool can be helpful if you are learning to sing Georgian traditional songs 
              and wish to follow their authentic sound. Besides, if you plan to transcribe
              Georgian songs using the 12-TET system, the chart can help you identify notes
              from the Georgian tuning that do not align with standard piano pitches. It may
              be useful for singers, producers, and choir directors alike. Finally, it helps
              explain why Georgian singing can sometimes sound “out of tune” to those
              accustomed to Western tuning.
